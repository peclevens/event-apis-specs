# Event APIs Specifications
Event management APIs specification and documentation.

### API Specific docs
- [Event API](./reference/event-api/README.md)

### NOTES
- The following JSON schema keywords `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `allOf` are valid in OpenAPI 3.0, but they are not yet supported in `Swagger Editor` nor in `Postman` which will prevent some schemas from being validated or loaded without issue.
