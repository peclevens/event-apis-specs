Etag:
  name: Etag
  description: |
    The RFC7232 ETag header field in a response provides the current entity-
    tag for the selected resource. An entity-tag is an opaque identifier for
    different versions of a resource over time, regardless whether multiple
    versions are valid at the same time. An entity-tag consists of an opaque
    quoted string, possibly prefixed by a weakness indicator.

  example: W/"xy", "5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"

IfMatch:
  name: If-Match
  description: |
    The RFC7232 If-Match header field in a request requires the server to
    only operate on the resource that matches at least one of the provided
    entity-tags. This allows clients express a precondition that prevent
    the method from being applied if there have been any changes to the
    resource.

IfNoneMatch:

  description: |
    The RFC7232 If-None-Match header field in a request requires the server

    entity-tags. If the provided entity-tag is `*`, it is required that the
    resource does not exist at all.

X-As-User:
  name: X-As-User
  description: |
    The X-As-User header is used by administrators to make API calls
    for their managed users. It can also be used by a Service Account to 
    make API calls for managed users or app users. 

    You will have to pass 
    the user id to impersonate. These API calls require the requests to 
    come from an Admin, a Co-admin, or a Service Account to be successful.

    NOTE: Admins can use this header to impersonate any managed users 
    including co-admins. Co-admins can use it to impersonate managed users, 
    but cannot impersonate any admin or co-admin.
  in: header
  required: false
  schema:
    type: string
    example: es;q=1
